# Summary
_Firn Protocol_ is offering _LunarDAO_ an investment opportunity in the form of an OTC sale.
The proposed investment is in the amount of $30,000 worth of $ETH in exchange for $45,000 worth of $FIRN token.
Both spot prices will be calculated on some fixed, pre-approved date (for example, the date of the vote).
If the proposal is accepted, the purchased $FIRN token will be locked in a _Team Finance_ vault for a period of 12 months. During this lock period, the tokens will nonetheless accrue fees; these fees will be disbursed directly to the control of the LunarDAO treasury.
LunarDAO and Firn Protocol will work closely to grow the value and reach of both parties.

# Problem
The proposal is needed to provide value and returns to DAO members, and to advance the DAO’s goal of funding—and making widely available—privacy solutions of superb quality.

# Solution
The solution takes the form of this investment proposal, as well as of a continuing close collaboration between Firn and LunarDAO.

# Implementation
The DAO’s Ether shall be transferred to the `firn.eth` multisignature (of address `0xa14664a2E58e804669E9fF1DFbC1bD981E13B0dC`).
Subsequently, Firn shall place the allotted $FIRN token into the team.finance locking contract, which will be owned by the LunarDAO treasury contract (of address `0x59f77dc848c2e45b5954975ee1969e7a22fa25f6`).
When the 12-month locking period ends, the total $FIRN token balance will be automatically released to the LunarDAO treasury.
In the meantime, all fees disbursed to the locking contract will be placed under the control of the DAO treasury address (per the logic of the locking contract).
