- Status: Proposal

- Vote Date: To be updated

**Summary**

This proposal suggests the creation of an NFT series as a means to support LunarDAO operations, provide education and research, and potentially serve as a 1 of 1 NFT or a generative profile picture (PFP) project.

**Problem**

LunarDAO requires additional financial resources to support its ongoing operations and various initiatives. Traditional fundraising methods may not be sufficient or aligned with the ethos of the LunarDAO community. Therefore, alternative approaches need to be explored to generate sustainable funding.

**Solution**

By creating an NFT series, LunarDAO can tap into the thriving art market and enthusiastic NFT community, while showcasing the creativity and talent within its ecosystem to attract art collectors, crypto enthusiasts, and NFT connoisseurs. Serving as a bridge between LunarDAO and the broader art market, the NFTs can establish connections and collaborations with established artists and platforms, bringing attention to LunarDAO's mission, values, and initiatives. This initiative acts as a catalyst for community engagement, fostering discussions, collaborations, and partnerships with like-minded individuals. The NFT series serves as a means to support LunarDAO operations, fund education and research initiatives, and can take the form of unique 1 of 1 NFTs or a generative PFP project with algorithmically generated NFTs.

**Implementation**

To implement this proposal, the following resources and actions are needed:

1. Collaborate with artists and designers to create the NFT series.

2. Define the theme, style, and artistic direction for the NFTs.

3. Establish a smart contract to mint and manage the NFTs.

4. Determine the distribution mechanism, such as direct sales, auctions, or a combination of both.

5. Allocate a portion of the proceeds from NFT sales to support LunarDAO operations, education, and research.

6. Promote the NFT series through various channels to attract collectors and investors.

7. Regularly engage with the community and provide updates on the progress and impact of the NFT series.
