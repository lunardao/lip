# LIP-0002

**Note:** *This is a draft of the proposal to initiate a discussion. The discussion will shape the final proposal to a form which will be submitted to a vote. LunarDAO Stewards don't have any power to force any decisions nor wish to act in ways which is damaging for the DAO.*  
**Note2:** *The final proposal will be adjusted according to the ETH spot price at the time of submitting.*  
**Note3:** *This proposal was adjusted based on the community feedback.*   
**Forum Discussion:** https://forum.lunardao.net/t/lip-0002-funding-lunardao-operation-costs 

## Summary

An overview of all operational expenses of LunarDAO and proposed fractal of compensation to all of the contributors in the creation and development of the DAO, that includes all the external contributors and six anon founders (called Stewards). The compensation payment is to be discussed by the entire community and voted on by the LunarDAO Squad.

## Problem

The journey of building LunarDAO started in October 2022. The research and implementation of the right architecture was a process which was longer than expected as the initial community shared opinions and proposals which brought us in another direction. We wanted to build a design that was bullet proof and also have broad support. The result is an architecture based on Moloch V3 run on DAOhaus frontend. This process also included building trust, reaching out and researching possible future investments. Besides that, extensive time and effort has been given to the privacy research published in wiki.lunardao.net. Some expenses needed to be covered up front and the core team took an initial loan of 7.075 ETH to cover those. These were mostly used for smart contract development, setting up infrastructure, services, domains and marketing. None of the core team members have taken payment. 

We have been supported by a number of external lunarpunks who participated in this development, without compensation as well.  

### Expenses for Stewards & Externals

Columns *"Compensation"* and *"Total"* display the sum we agreed upon among Stewards and with externals as an income for the given work, time and energy.

## Solution

The DAO can always be operated with community volunteers, however as the core team gave birth to this project there are also unique incentives to see it succeed in the long term.  These efforts have been mission essential for LunarDAO and if the members appreciate and value this work we hope to continue developing the DAO for long into the future.

LunarDAO Stewards are aware of the reality where to ask for any meaningful compensation would be too harmful to the treasury and it would be a bad signal for the future investors. At the same time we cannot continue to work in the same way we did until now unless there is some operational coverage. 

From the narrow choice of possibilities, we want to find a solution which is the best for the DAO mission and includes long term sustainability. With that we will propose an ultra-minimalistic support from the DAO and a joint commitment to find solution in a mid-term future. 

The LunarDAO community shared some ideas for the next steps to make sure the investors aren't responsible for all the operation costs, while these expences are seen as fundamental and addressed in another way. The possibilities are:

1. Create NFT series as a support for the LunarDAO operations and provided education and research.
2. Launch $LUNAR, a tradable community/support token, with allocation for the DAO, the Stewards, research, education etc (the contracts and front end is already existing).
3. Re-open the conversation about grant application. Make a clear distinction between the venture and educational sides of the DAO, where the grants are asked for the shared knowledge, research, manuals etcetera and the venture DAO pays fees/LIP proposals for the dev and research related to the investments.

We are not proposing to decide on these points as part of this LIP, but we share them to signal our commitment to find a sustainable solution together.  

If the Squad sees value in the work done so far, and the function of Stewards for DAO future development, they can vote for this proposal.

## Implementation

**In total we would like to ask for 5.075 ETH worth of $VOX.** 

This sum covers **8.87%** of all the listed expenses, calculated in USD terms @ 1 ETH = $1850 (percentage count does not include the already applied generous discount from DAOhaus devs). This proposal is to cover already paid works/services listed as *tx1, tx2 and tx3 (not tx4)* under *references* to the *Initial Loan* and 1 ETH for DAOhaus. The remaining *tx4* and all the compensation for Stewards and external contributors to be addressed in the future potentially through the above mentioned options.

The proposed compensation in newly minted $VOX (representing 5.075 ETH), will include all the transactions in a multicall proposal and distributed directly to separated wallets (3 lenders and DAOhaus dev). ***No ETH withdrawal from the treasury!*** 

It's a small investment into the foundation that the Genesis of LunarDAO is based on, and investment and commitment for the future success of lunarpunk movement. As an addition to this proposal is a social contract that none of the recievers will exit (RageQuit) with their $VOX till the next raise.

These are the four accounts with the proposed funding:

| TARGET | ACCOUNT | ETH | $VOX |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DAOhaus dev | 0xa03d87e1d765b05548f1a3ec3fe67d36d7b11d50 | 1.00 | 119.5312124168481 |
| lender-tx1 | 0xb31d59cdd3ebb5e86d0c775b3449838b066a8661 | 2.465 | 294.64443860753056 |
| lender-tx2 | 0xfabb63077cdd022efc2145720fee7403e602b466 | 0.83 | 99.21090630598393 |
| lender-tx3 | 0xb5407fd442f9bd01e24cd8b671264b3b0b7cb854 | 0.78 | 93.23434568514152 |
| TOTAL | | 5.075 | 606.6209030155042 |


## Community Input

It's important that the community engage in a discussion and share perspectives on this proposal as well as expectations for the future, both in regards to the direction of the DAO as well as the responsibility of the Stewards, if there are concerns or objections.

## Calculation of $VOX Allocation

For reference we add the calculation based on the formula shared in the [wiki](https://wiki.lunardao.net/calculation.html) and LunarDAO Whiteparer. 

The steps displayed below are:

1. Count how many $VOX (shares) to mint to represent 5.075 ETH (after the minting) based on the current treasury numbers.
2. Count distribution between the 4 accounts based on the ETH value to be allocated.
3. Test the calculations
4. Multiply each allocation by 10^18 as the proposal takes no decimal separators and figures need to be submitted with 18 decimals.

```
total_treasury = 31.05905
total_shares = 3105.905
allocated_eth = 5.075
minted_shares = ( total_shares / ( 1 - ( allocated_eth / total_treasury ))) - total_shares
minted_shares = 606.6209030155042

daohaus_dev = minted_shares / 5.075 * 1
lender_tx1 = minted_shares / 5.075 * 2.465
lender_tx2 = minted_shares / 5.075 * 0.83
lender_tx3 = minted_shares / 5.075 * 0.78
daohaus_dev = 119.5312124168481
lender_tx1 = 294.64443860753056
lender_tx2 = 99.21090630598393
lender_tx3 = 93.23434568514152
 
test1 = daohaus_dev + lender_tx1 + lender_tx2 + lender_tx3
test1 == minted shares
test2 = (( total_shares + minted_shares ) / total_treasury ) * 5.075
test2 == minted_shares

daohaus_dev = 119.5312124168481 * 10 ^ 18 = 119531212416848100000
lender_tx1 = 294.64443860753056 * 10 ^ 18 = 294644438607530560000
lender_tx2 = 99.21090630598393 * 10 ^ 18 = 99210906305983930000
lender_tx3 = 93.23434568514152 * 10 ^ 18 = 93234345685141520000
```
